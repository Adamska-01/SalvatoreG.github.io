<span class="paragraph">
	Second game made with SDL. Thanks to all the knowledge acquired in my first attempt, I was able to create a 2D arcade game similar to the famous Puzzle Bobble.
</span>
<span class="paragraph">
	I have re-used some of the SDL subsystems implementation I already had, and made a couple of adjustments to animate the bobble states.
</span>
<span class="paragraph">Additionally I have added the following features to the SDL framework:</span>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding-right:7px; list-style-type: disc;">
	<li>Texture rotation.</li>
	<li>Controller input (Multiplayer support).</li>
	<li>Audio support.</li>
	<li>Text rendering improvements.</li>
	<li>General improvements'.</li>
</ul>
