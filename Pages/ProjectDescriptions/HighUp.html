	Upon joining West Pier Studio, I was given the chance to lead the development of a robust vehicle customization system in Unreal Engine 5. This was 
	an attempt in trying to get visibility and acquire clients to co-develop AAA games.
</span>
<span class="paragraph">As part of the process, I gained experience in:</span>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding-right:7px; list-style-type: disc;">
	<li>Developed a full vehicle customization system (Parts, colors, liveries).</li>
	<li>Implementation of blueprints that allow designers to easily create vehicle parts (Adding functionalities such as color/livery swap thanks to actor components) and add them to the game.</li>
	<li>Created a fully packaged (portable) version of Unreal with PlayStation 5 build support to speed up the building process.</li>
	<li>Designed and implemented custom UI widgets to overcome Unreal's UI limitations, such as pop-up buttons, bindable widgets, and a carousel system.</li>
	<li>Designed and Implemented a proxy to easily bind widget events without the use of Unreal Functions (UFUNCTIONS).</li>
	<li>Developed a custom UI navigation system that works with gamepads controls.</li>
</ul>
