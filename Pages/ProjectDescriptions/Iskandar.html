	Mysteric Studios was created by a group of university students with the aim to create and publish an RPG Adventure game. We were no more than 20 
	individuals with different backgrounds such as game design, software development, and art.
</span>
<span class="paragraph">As a gameplay programmer, I was tasked with designing and implementing the following:</span>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding-right:7px; list-style-type: disc;">
	<li>Inventory system along with the UI (using scriptable objects), which was also used to add functionalities like equipment (with stats update), accessories with special abilities, and shops.</li>
	<li>Loot system with logarithmic drop chance.</li>
	<li>One of the puzzles in the game.</li>
	<li>Helped with the event system.</li>
	<li>I have also had the chance to make some 3D models using 3ds Max.</li>
</ul>

	'Agile methodologies' were applied during development.
