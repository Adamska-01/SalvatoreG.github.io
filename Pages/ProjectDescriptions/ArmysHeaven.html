	Army's Heaven is a Single Player/Multiplayer FPS game that makes use of PUN2 (Photon Unity Package) for its multiplayer backend. 
	Originally conceived as a multiplayer project, the game currently features a deathmatch mode and offers a selection of two distinct maps.

	I am currently focusing on the single player mode that will provide a campaign of a few hours, and introduce all the mechanics that I will
	transfer back in the multiplayer modes.
</span>
<span class="paragraph">Here are some of the things I am currently working on:</span>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding-right:7px; list-style-type: disc;">
	<li>General Character Controller refactor.</li>
	<li>Replacing the current hand rig with new ones from an asset pack (introducing new guns, new animations, etc..).</li>
	<li>Replace shooting system with the one used in the multiplayer.</li>
	<li>Fix any potential issues with the zombies/npc AI that will (for sure) arise at the end of the refactor.</li>
	<li>Implementing an event system similar to the one used in 'Deck Planner'.</li>
</ul>
