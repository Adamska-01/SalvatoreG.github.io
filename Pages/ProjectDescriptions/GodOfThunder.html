	The primary objective of this project was to explore the development of a 2D platformer optimized for mobile devices, aiming for a seamless 
	and enjoyable gaming experience on such platforms.

	Inspired by the classic MS-DOS game 'God of Thunder,' I tried to create a game world that dynamically adjusts to fit the dimensions of the 
	player's device, ensuring optimal scaling and immersive gameplay across various screen sizes.

	In addition to scaling adaptability, I incorporated various modern game design elements, such as intuitive touch controls, fluid animations, 
	and engaging level designs to enhance the overall experience.
