	This project marks my first attempt to make a game using the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library.

	I took inspiration from Super Mario and tried to make a clone of it. This gave me the chance to learn about SDL and develop a wrapper around it that 
	would allow me to create games more easily."
