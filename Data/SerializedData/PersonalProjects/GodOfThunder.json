		"The primary objective of this project was to explore the development of a 2D platformer optimized for mobile devices, aiming for a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience on such platforms.",
		"Inspired by the classic MS-DOS game 'God of Thunder,' I tried to create a game world that dynamically adjusts to fit the dimensions of the player's device, ensuring optimal scaling and immersive gameplay across various screen sizes.",
