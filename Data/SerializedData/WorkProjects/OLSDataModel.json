			"text": "To ensure consistency and reduce code duplication, the models are packaged and distributed as both a <span class='text-color-green'>versioned NuGet package</span> for the API and QA Dashboard, and a <span class='text-color-green'>Unity package</span> compatible with the Unity Package Manager (UPM) for the Unity apps."

			"text": "Unity in particular required custom handling due to its requirement for <span class='text-color-green'><code>.meta</code></span> files for every file and folder the package includes. Additionally, its limited support for modern .NET features like <span class='text-color-green'><code>init</code></span>, <span class='text-color-green'><code>records</code></span>, <span class='text-color-green'><code>with</code></span>, and the <span class='text-color-green'><code>System.Text.Json</code></span> serializer introduced compatibility challenges."
